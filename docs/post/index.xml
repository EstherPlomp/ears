      <description>Evolutionary Anthropology Reproducibility Study
Our project aims to assess and improve the scientific reproducibility of research within the field of evolutionary anthropology.
Reproducible research practices include sharing raw and processed data, analytical code and documenting software and workflows to enable the reproduction of original research results. This is different from replication, which involves establishing findings with new data (e.g.Â different species, sample, environment). Reproducibility is a criterion for responsible scientific output, but importantly, allows for increased engagement with research, offers opportunities for collaboration and improves productivity.</description>
