      <description>Evolutionary Anthropology Reproducibility Study
Our project aims to assess and improve the scientific reproducibility of research within the field of evolutionary anthropology.
Reproducible research practices include sharing raw and processed data, analytical code and documenting software and workflows to enable the reproduction of original research results. This is different from replication, which involves establishing findings with new data (e.g.Â different species, sample, environment). Reproducibility is a criterion for responsible scientific output, but importantly, allows for increased engagement with research, offers opportunities for collaboration and improves productivity.</description>

      <description>Riana Minocher
riana_minocher@eva.mpg.de
I am a PhD student in the Department for Human Behaviour, Ecology and Culture at the Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. I am interested in understanding the processes that generate, maintain and affect the patterns of cultural diversity we can observe. During my PhD, I plan to develop theory about the transmission of multiple cultural traits under different social and ecological contexts. I will link this theory to data I collect in the field, and develop (reproducible) research methods to do so.</description>
