      <p>Our project aims to assess and improve the scientific reproducibility of research within the field of evolutionary anthropology.</p>
<p>Reproducible research practices include sharing data, analysis code and documenting workflows to enable the reproduction of original work. This is different from replication, which would involve establishing findings in an independent context (e.g. different method, species, sample). Reproducibility is a criterion for responsible scientific output, but importantly, allows for increased engagement with research, offers opportunities for collaboration and improves productivity. This is because transparent research methods and available data allow us to improve on existing ways to answer questions, as well as devise new ways to answer questions.</p>
<p>To do this, we are first conducting a survey on data availability, author accessibility and scientific reproducibility of published empirical work on “social learning”. This is a dense and diverse literature, contributed to by researchers from biology, psychology, sociology, economics, anthropology, philosophy and archaeology. We thus hope our project will have an impact on a wide audience. You can find a current version of the preregistration for our first study [here].</p>
<p>We would also like to develop a repository online of reproducible social learning research, to serve as a resource for any interested researcher in this field. We would contact you to ask if you are interested in having us host your work here, as we begin to develop this database.</p>
<p>This work forms part of my PhD research, which will involve developing and refining methods to study the transmission processes underlying the distribution of cultural traits in and among populations.</p>
