## ears: evolutionary anthropology reproducibility study

Our project aims to improve the scientific reproducibility of research within the field of evolutionary anthropology. 

We are conducting a survey on data availability, author accessibility and scientific reproducibility of published empirical work on "social learning". This is a dense and diverse literature, contributed to by researchers from biology, psychology, sociology, economics, anthropology, philosophy and archaeology. We thus hope our project will have an impact on a wide audience. 

You can find a current version of the [preregistration](./docs/reproducibility-study-outline.pdf) for our first study in this repository, under docs/reproducibility-study-outline.pdf

This work forms part of my PhD research, which will involve developing and refining methods to study the transmission processes underlying the distribution of cultural traits in and among populations.
